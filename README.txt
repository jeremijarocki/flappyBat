This is a first try to create a simple game - Flappy Bird based.
Please run the flappyBat.jar file through your console, Git Bash, PowerShell or by just clicking it.
I hope you will like it.
Graphics are not the best, i know, but i am not an expert yet in this matter.
I will try to improve them in next commits, so the whole game looks better and gives more fun while playing.
Sprites have been added manually to zip archive.

To fly with the bat, please press SPACE.
If you die, please press B to start a new game.

PS Lack of consistency with the name was caused, because of changing the idea for the game in the middle of work :)
